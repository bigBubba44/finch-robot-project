# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
 In this project we used the finch to "Dance" and draw a star, albeit a funny looking one, but we used the marker, some lights and got our bird to draw a star.
## Challenges faced and solutions
The top part of the star does look a little off, and it might not connect the whole star because of the angles being slightly off by a value or two so we had a difficult time trying to perfect it. In the end it worked, despite the difficulties with files not working or small bugs.
## Future enhancements
If we had more time to work on it, we'd probbly perfect the angles and try to add more to it than just the stars and the lighting. More comments, clean up the code, add some for loops and just make it do more in general. Maybe get it to fill in the lines like the painter class, or just experiment with the limits of the birdy.
